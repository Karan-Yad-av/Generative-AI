        "\n",
        "    **PYTHON** :-Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is easy to read and write. It supports multiple programming styles such as object-oriented, functional, and scripting programming. Python is widely used for web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and many other.\n",
        "\n",
        "    It is popular for following reasons :\n",
        "      *   **Simple and Easy to Learn** :-> Python has a clean and readable syntax, which makes it easier for beginners to understand compared to many other programming languages.\n",
        "      *   **Large Standard Library** :-> It includes many built-in modules and functions that help perform different tasks without writing extra code.\n",
        "      *   **Flexible** :-> Python is used in many fields such as web development, data analysis, AI, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing.\n",
        "      * **Community Support** :-> Python has a large and active community that continuously creates libraries, provides tutorials, and helps solve problems.\n",
        "      * **Cross-Platform Language** :-> Python works on different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it highly accessible.\n",

        "\n",
        "    An interpreter in Python is a program that reads Python code line by line and converts it into machine-understandable instructions so the computer can execute it. Instead of compiling the entire program at once, the interpreter processes each line immediately, which makes Python easy to test and debug.\n",
